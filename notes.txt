Different moving parts:

o View that shows the tracks of the touches
* Proxy that wraps gesture recognizers that broadcasts when it receives gestures and
  state changes
* Timeline that increases as the gesture drag happens (like instrumentstâ„¢)
  * User can add / remove recognizers.
  * Each gets a different color (or something)
  * as the gesture is in flight, show the different states (maybe by line pattern, or
    text label)
  * Let the user set 'must fail', and associated gizmos
o Done - Scrubber, to play back the gesture as it happened
  * need to make it look purty
o Done - text view that shows NSLogs as they happen

* Support all the apple gesture recognizers
* Find some from books and the intertubes
