GestureLab
==========

Playground for gesture recognizers.  Might rule.  Might suck.

Here it is in action:

![Gesture Lab in Action](http://borkware.com/bnr/gesture-recognizer-screenshot.png)

Tap-and drag in the "Gesture Here" area.  Anything logged by the program, such
as NSLogs from the gesture recognizers, gets put into a scrolling text field.  The
active gesture recognizers are on a timeline at the top.

When you're done tapping and dragging, you can replay the events by dragging around in
the timeline, seeing the different parts of the getures being drawn, in a different
color for each finger/drag combination.

Got a recognizier firing early?  You can see what the tap-track looked like that might
have confused thing.  Ever wondered what a cat print looks like?  Start this running
and let a cat walk across the iPad.

A description of the logging hijacking will appear on the Big Nerd Ranch blog.
